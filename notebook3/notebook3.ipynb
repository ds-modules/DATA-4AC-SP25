    "\n",
    "In 2011, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the severity of overcrowding in California prisons had resulted in failures to meet the mental and medical health needs of incarcerated people. These failures were so extreme, the Court argued, that life in California prisons constituted cruel and unusual punishment—a violation of the Eighth Amendment. It was “an uncontested fact,” the Supreme Court upheld, that “an inmate in one of California’s prisons needlessly dies every six or seven days due to constitutional deficiencies” caused by overcrowding ([Brown v. Plata, Opinion of the Court](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-1233.ZO.html)). At the time, California prisons held 156,000 residents, nearly 200% of the 80,000 total resident capacity the institutions were designed for. The Court ordered that the state reduce its prison population to 137.5% of its designed capacity (around 110,000 individuals) within two years. A population reduction of as many as 46,000 incarcerated people was ordered **\"as a remedy to cure a systemic violation of the Eighth Amendment\"** ([Brown v. Plata, Opinion of the Court](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-1233.ZO.html)).<br><br>\n",

    "Realignment made no direct reforms to conditions, programs, or policies *within* state prisons, and instead aimed to improve medical and mental healthcare inside by reducing the load of overcrowding on already existing services. Realignment also did not relocate any of those currently serving similar sentences in state prisons to county jails.

    "Prisons and jails serve very different purposes within the prison industrial complex, and, as such, are designed with different priorities and expectations in mind. Prisons are state- or federally-controlled facilities where people who have been convicted of more serious crimes, often felonies, serve their sentences. Jails, on the other hand, are city- or county-controlled facilities where people who are awaiting trial, or who have been convicted of low-level offenses (with sentences typically less than one year) are detained ([Vera, 2023](https://www.vera.org/news/u-s-jails-and-prisons-explained)). Nearly 70% of those incarcerated in jails, about 450,000 people, have not yet been found guilty of a crime. Many of these people remain in jail despite their legal innocence because they are unable to afford bail ([Prison Policy Initiative, 2024](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2024.html)). California's choice to reduce prison populations by increasing jail populations did not take into account the inherent differences in the design, culture, and population dynamics of these institutions, resulting in a number of foreseeable incongruities.\n",
    "\n",
    "County jails were not designed to hold as many people, for longer sentences, as they were required to hold following Realignment. By changing the context of these jails, placing added stress on already deteriorating and understaffed facilities, violence in jails surged across California. The increase in violence was unprecendented, but not unexpected. In an interview with the Sacramento Bee, Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims \"said 2018’s record number of fatalities inside her jail was predictable,\" and \"repeatedly characterized such deaths as an unfortunate consequence of jail life after realignment and expressed no remorse over her office’s failure to prevent them\" ([Sacramento Bee, 2019](https://www.sacbee.com/news/investigations/california-prisons/article229376524.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disproportionate effects and differential representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Not captured in population data is the disproportionate vulnerability and opportunity created by Realignment. Rather than thoughtlessly reproducing the gender binary of the data we are working with by using the population data and its provided features without question, it's important to think about why and how gender matters in the stories we tell about Realignment. One study of the data, for instance, shows that disproportionately fewer women were incarcerated in California prisons following Realignment (78.5% fewer women entered prison in 2012 than in 2010, while only 67.8% fewer men entered prison over the same period) ([Maternal and Child Health Journal, 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8720545/)). Using population data can provide some insights, such as the fact that women who had given birth were more likely than those who hadn't to be convicted of non-violent crimes, but it cannot tell us other stories that matter—such as the experience of pregnancy in jails or prisons. In their [*Advancing Transgender Justice*](https://www.vera.org/advancing-transgender-justice) report, the Vera Institute of Justice attempt to illuminate stories that are similarly invisibilized in CDCR population data. They use tools, lines of questioning, habits, and perspectives that are not readily applicable to population-level data to inform the public and policymakers with stories of the transgender experience behind bars."

    "Passed by voters in 2014, California's Proposition 47 reclassified some felony drug and property offenses (with theft not exceeding $950) as misdemeanors. Before its passing, Realignment struggled to reduce the state prison population to the %137.5 of design capacity mandated by the Supreme Court. Within two years of Prop 47's passing, the total jail and prison population had fallen by roughly 13,000, the CDCR fulfilling the Supreme Court's mandate as a result ([PPIC, 2024](https://www.ppic.org/publication/crime-after-proposition-47-and-the-pandemic/)). Take a second to note this drop in the visualizations we plotted above. In its current framing, the population-level data we are working with does not satisfyingly tell the story of Proposition 47, nor the stories of parole reformation and effects on recidivism that came part and parcel with Realignment. Yet, despite the suite of reform efforts that came with Realignment, CA prisons and jails remained overcrowded, and the systemic human rights violations that drew the Supreme Court's attention in 2011 resurfaced during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n"

    "Without direct changes to prison conditions, policies, and ideologies, people incarcerated in California prisons continued to struggle with many of the same mental and medical healthcare crises that the Supreme Court decalred unconstitutional in 2011. The experience of COVID-19 in prisons across the country, and especially California, brought persistent, systemic human rights violations obscured by population success stories to the forefront of attention.\n",
