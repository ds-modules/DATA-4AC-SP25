    "Epidemiology is the \"branch of medical science that deals with the incidence, distribution, and control of disease in a population\" ([Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/epidemiology)). Epidemiologists often work for federal, state, and local health departments, informing policy decisions to understand and curb disease spread.\n",

    "The first source that we'll be taking a look at comes from [The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology](https://accp1.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcph.1937) and was written by Martha J. Ignaszewski MD, FRCPC. The article goes through the epidemiology of the most common substance addictions in the United States. The second source that we'll be utilizing comes from the [European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction](https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/html/pods/waste-water-analysis_en) and features an analysis of wastewater and drugs in a handful of European cities.\n",

Nicotine, alcohol, and cannabis are identified as the three most widely used substances in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "In their own sections, the author offers a finer grain analysis of nicotine, alcohol, and cannabis use trends in the United States by adolescents and adults. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the final three sections, on societal impact, treatment access, and COVID-19, the author discusses the uneven landscape in who is affected by substance use disorders and who is most able to receive treatment. The author concludes with an analysis of the big-picture effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Americans' access to substances and treatment.\n",

    "## 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The epidemiological studies we looked at in this notebook use data science to communicate the state of substance use in a given region to relevant policy makers and officials. Data, in this way, is used to provide a sightline into conditions \"on the ground,\" and changes in the data reflect improving or worsening states of illicit drug consumption across communities. This way of thinking about monitoring and controlling substance use makes a number of assumptions. Before we close out our discussion, let's think about some of these assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vulnerable Populations and Unreliable Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Drugs users are, in general, a vulnerable population, Drug users have unique medical needs, and are disproportionately subjected to medical surveillance and state violence. Epidemiological data is incredibly important, but also has acute potential to harm and infringe upon the dignity of vulnerable populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even broadly speaking, self-reported data is prone to be unreliable. This is especially the case in epedmiological contexts, where accurate data is imperative and subject matter is sensitive and/or stigmatized. It is very important for the state and institutions to figure out ways to access more accurate data so that public health officials can do their best work. Wastewater analysis is imperfect, but comes from this need.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with many of the data practices used to assess population attributes, wastewater analysis operates through proxies. This results in a number of encoded assumptions about substance use and users. Measuring the metabolites and residues of substances in wastewater gives scientists only a very rough picture of what is actually being consumed. The milligrams of benzoylecgonine (BE), the compound that cocaine is metabolized into in the body, found in the wastewater at a given processing plant does not capture how the cocaine was consumed, if the consumption was intentional, or how pure it is. Drugs like cocaine sometimes include additives, like baking soda, which can be used to dilute the supply of actual cocaine to increase profits. Othertimes, impure cocaine includes amphetamines, caffeine, and other substances are used to alter the effect of the drug, potentially making it more addictive or dangerous. Additionally, the use of wastewater analysis assumes that drug users (and patients, in general) have relationships with doctors that preclude honesty about drug use. As such, the technology of wastewater analysis becomes a way for data scientists to bypass the authority and expertise of drug users on the basis of their assumed dishonesty.\n",
